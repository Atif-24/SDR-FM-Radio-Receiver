This project serves as my first foray into the world of software-defined radio (SDR), specifically utilizing RTL-SDR and GNU Radio. Considered to be the "hello world" of SDR, it has provided me with an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of SDR and create a useful FM radio receiver. Throughout the development process, I enjoyed working with RTL-SDR and discovered that GNU Radio shares similarities with Simulink, making it an intuitive platform to work with.

## Overview

The FM Radio Receiver is designed to receive FM radio signals across a wide frequency range of 88 to 107 MHz. By leveraging RTL-SDR and GNU Radio, this project enables users to tune in to their favorite radio stations with ease. Additionally, it includes features such as user-friendly station switching and frequency monitoring with a visual waterfall spectrogram, all aimed at enhancing convenience, usability, and reception quality for listeners.

## Features

- Wide Frequency Range: Covering frequencies from 88 to 107 MHz, the FM Radio Receiver allows users to explore a diverse range of FM radio stations.

- User-Friendly Station Switching: Seamlessly switch between four local radio stations using an intuitive and user-friendly interface, improving convenience and usability.

- Frequency Monitoring and Visualization: The integration of a frequency monitoring capability provides users with real-time feedback on reception quality. The visual waterfall spectrogram offers a comprehensive and visual representation of the received frequencies, aiding in optimal reception and quality assessment.

## RTL-SDR Device and Antenna

For this project, I used the NooElec NESDR Mini 2+ as my RTL-SDR device along with the antenna that came with it. The NooElec NESDR Mini 2+ is a popular and reliable RTL-SDR device that offers excellent performance for a wide range of applications.

If you are interested in using the same RTL-SDR device, you can find it on Amazon: [NooElec NESDR Mini 2+](https://www.amazon.ca/NooElec-NESDR-Mini-Compatible-Packages/dp/B00VZ1AWQA/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=nooelec+mini+2%2B&s=electronics&sr=1-3). It comes bundled with the necessary accessories, including the antenna, making it a convenient choice for getting started with RTL-SDR.

## Installation

To install and use the FM Radio Receiver, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, including RTL-SDR and GNU Radio.
3. Connect the NooElec NESDR Mini 2+ device to your computer using the provided USB cable.
4. Attach the antenna that came with the NooElec NESDR Mini 2+ to the device.
5. Run the FM Radio Receiver application.
